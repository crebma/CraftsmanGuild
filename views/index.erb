        <p>That's right folks, we're doing a complete reboot of Craftsman Guild! In case you haven't heard, we're going
            to
            change the format up a little bit! None of this is set in stone, and if you don't like the change, speak up,
            let's talk about it! We are going to start collecting topics via google form, and try to pick stuff way
            ahead
            of time, instead of voting from week to week. We are also going to go down to every other week. That means
            the
            next meeting won't be until 3/5, but it will be at the same time and place.</p>

        </p>If you want to submit a talk proposal for Craftsman Guild, you can do it
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CCTJ2kjZPrEkCQG6lSqjS7U9MIGd9fELBal1-cbZsMM/viewform">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Also, if there's someone or something you'd like to hear a talk about at this reboot next week, let me know!
            I'll reach out to them and see if they're interested! If you prefer to just email me and not the whole
            google group, <a href="mailto:craftsmanguildmi@gmail.com">go ahead</a>.</p>
